# FreshBytes Hardware

All of the hardware needed to run FreshBytes, a hydroponic and aquaponic monitoring and control system. The system runs on [this software](https://github.com/jackbowen/FreshBytes-Backend) and is interacted with through [this app](https://github.com/jackbowen/FreshBytes-WebApp).
